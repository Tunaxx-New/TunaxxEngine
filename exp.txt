// ...Amd(oops And), i got it; I Have function draw in RasterEngine that (in past) call gpu_.execute - different executes overloaded
//execute(bitmap*, randomPixels) - executes Fill, that fills bitmap with vector Pixels
//TODO:
//executeMandelbrotSet(bitmap*) - to see how fast gpu can be
//executeConwayGoL(bitmap*)     - to see how fast gpu can be

// Fractal - V this is something beautiful
// gol     - V cool, i found that random tiles have same
